# Financial Anomaly Detection MLOps Platform

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a comprehensive 4-week MVP for implementing an end-to-end MLOps platform specifically designed for **anomaly detection in financial and regulatory data**. The solution leverages proven machine learning operations practices to deliver real-time anomaly detection, forecasting capabilities, and explainable AI insights for financial compliance and risk management.

## Understanding Classification Problems and Anomaly Detection

**Classification problems** form the backbone of many machine learning applications, where models learn to categorize data points into discrete classes or labels. In the context of financial services, classification techniques are particularly powerful for:

- **Binary Classification**: Normal vs. Anomalous transactions
- **Multi-class Classification**: Categorizing different types of financial irregularities
- **Anomaly Detection**: A specialized application of classification that identifies unusual patterns, outliers, or suspicious activities that deviate from normal behavior

**Anomaly detection is a critical use case** for financial institutions because it enables:
- **Fraud Detection**: Identifying suspicious transactions or account activities
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Flagging potential violations or reporting anomalies
- **Risk Management**: Early detection of unusual market patterns or operational risks
- **Quality Assurance**: Identifying data quality issues in financial reporting

The proposed platform transforms traditional supervised classification into a sophisticated anomaly detection system by treating normal patterns as one class and various types of anomalies as outliers or alternative classes.
